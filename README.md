# Enterprise Document Flow System

Document Flow Enterprise System developed 
with legacy Delphi and modern design approaches including Layered Architecture, DDD (Domain-Driven Design), CQRS, GoF, SOLID, GRASP, Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture and so forth. From the runtime architecture of view this is PostgreSQL-based fat client. 

The codebase hasn't opportuinity of compiling at given moment because it dependens on another units that aren't uploaded yet as well as it hasn't documentation to introduction in it's internals.

All of this will be made in time, but for now you can just familiarize with code.
